## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, TypeScript

This is a simple app built in React with TypeScript that lets you select a type of die to roll and then roll it. The form uses React useState to remember the selected die and when the button is clicked, generates a random number based on the selected die, then outputs it to the page. It also uses React useState to remember previous rolls and display them to the page alongside the type of die rolled.

Currently supported dice:

- d20
- d12
- d10
- d8
- d6
- d4
- d100
